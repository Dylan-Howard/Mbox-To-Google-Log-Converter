# Mbox To Google Log
Tools such as Gopher for Gmail rely on the Google Email Log Search to function. While helpful, this Google Workspace tool limits results to 1000 messages. In cases where messages numbering more than 1000 in count must be removed, this conversion tool creates a crucial bridge.

## Use
1. Download target messages from Google Vault as Mbox files.
2. Unzip and place Mbox files in the "import" folder.
3. Generate log by running this Go program.
4. Import log into Gopher for Gmail.
